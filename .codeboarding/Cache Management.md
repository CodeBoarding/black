## Component Details

The Cache Management component in Black handles the caching of formatted files to improve performance and avoid unnecessary reformatting. It determines the cache file location, reads and writes cached data, and checks if a file has been modified since it was last formatted. The component uses file metadata (modification time, size, and hash) to determine if a file needs to be reformatted.

### Cache
The Cache component manages the cache file, reading cached file data, checking if a file has changed, and writing updated file data to the cache. It uses pickle to serialize and deserialize the cache data, and interacts with FileData to determine if a file needs reformatting.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `black.cache.Cache` (56:150)
- `black.cache.Cache.read` (62:85)
- `black.cache.Cache.write` (133:150)
- `black.cache.Cache.is_changed` (102:116)
- `black.cache.Cache.get_file_data` (95:100)
- `black.cache.Cache.filtered_cached` (118:131)


### FileData
FileData is a data class that stores information about a file, including its last modification time, size, and hash. This information is used by the Cache component to determine if a file has changed since it was last cached.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `black.cache.FileData` (25:28)


### Cache Directory
The Cache Directory component determines the location of the cache directory on the file system. It uses the `platformdirs` library to find the user cache directory and allows customization via the `BLACK_CACHE_DIR` environment variable. The Cache File component uses this directory to construct the full path to the cache file.


**Related Classes/Methods**:

- `black.cache.get_cache_dir` (31:45)
- `black.cache.CACHE_DIR` (28:28)


### Cache File
The Cache File component determines the name and location of the cache file based on the formatting mode. It combines the cache directory (provided by the Cache Directory component) with a filename that includes a cache key derived from the formatting mode. The Cache component reads from and writes to this file.

- `black.cache.get_cache_file` (51:52)
